# Space_Ships_Game
This is a simple little Syfy shooter with space ships.
The sounds files are not working right now, So please down load other "MP3" to add your own. i did keep the files in the code to show you where the sounds files go.

Fell free to let me know if theres anything i can do to update or make my code better.

Thanks RooNe

Welcome to the Space_Ships_Game wiki! You have to install the pygame package you can do this by doing the following:

in the terminal in VS Code or PyCharm type

if that does not work try:

pip3 install pygame or "python3 -m install pygame"

once this is complete you can test this by running this code in a IDE
